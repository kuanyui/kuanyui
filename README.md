I develop and release **all** of my open-source software projects **for free**, and are ALL licensed under `WTFPL`, `GPL`, `MIT`, or `MPL`. 

However, my "free time" is not free actually. If my works are usable to you or make you happy, please consider to donate to reduce my business hours to **make more free and open-source projects for you and this world**:
