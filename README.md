I develop and release **all** of my open-source software projects **for free**, and are **all** licensed under `WTFPL`, `GPL`, `MIT`, or `MPL`. 

However, my "free time" is **not free** at all. If some of my works are usable to you or make you happy, please consider to donate (and tell me which project helps you, if can) to reduce my business hours to **make more free and open-source projects for you and this world**.

> Attention: Donate **only if you feel happy**; it is totally voluntary. I always try as possible as I can to make good project because I need, and wish my work could also be helpful to others. If you donate, I will be glad and grateful, **but I cannot provide any gurantee or warranty for the projects even if you do this**.
